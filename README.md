# React Getting Started
Setting up dev environment for ReactJs. This is a basic skeleton project to start your react journey.

Most of the depencies are already added to the package.json. Execute <code>npm install</code> in your project folder using any terminal [bash, cmd ...] to install the required dependencies.

# Other Dependencies 
There are a few pakages that are not included in the pacakge.json, and need to be installed explicitly. <br/>
_Navigate to the project folder using cmd/shell and execute the following commands,_

<code>npm install -g babel</code><br/>
<code>npm install -g babel-cli</code><br/>

<code>npm install babel-core</code><br/>
<code>npm install babel-loader</code><br/>
<code>npm install babel-preset-react</code><br/>
<code>npm install babel-preset-es2015</code>
